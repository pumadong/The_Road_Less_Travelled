# Dedication to Reality(忠于事实)
The third tool of discipline or technique of dealing with the pain of problem-solving, which must continually be employed(使用) if our lives are to be healthy and our spirits are to grow, is dedication to the truth. Superficially(表面地), this should be obvious. For truth is reality. That which is false is unreal. The more clearly we see the reality of the world, the better equipped(装备齐全的) we are to deal with the world. The less clearly we see the reality of the world-the more our minds are befuddled(迷惑) by falsehood(谎言), misperceptions(错觉) and illusions(假象)-the less able we will be to determine correct courses of action and make wise decisions. Our view of reality is like a map with which to negotiate the terrain(领域) of life. If the map is true and accurate, we will generally know where we are, and if we have decided where we want to go, we will generally know how to get there. If the map is false and inaccurate, we generally will be lost.


While this is obvious, it is something that most people to a greater or lesser degree to ignore. They ignore it because our route to reality is not easy. First of all, we are not born with maps; we have to make them, and the making requires effort. The more effort we make to appreciate(理解) and perceive reality, the larger and more accurate our maps will be. But many do not want to make this effort. Some stop making it by the end of adolescence. Their maps are small and sketchy(粗略的), their view of the world narrow and misleading(误导的). By the end of middle age most people have given up the effort. They feel certain that their maps are complete and their Weltanschauung(世界观) is correct(indeed, even sacrosanct(神圣不可侵犯的)), and they are no longer interested in new information. It is as if they are tired. Only a relative and fortunate few continue until the moment of death exploring the mystery of reality, ever(一直) enlarging(放大) and refining(精炼) and redefining(重新定义) their understanding of the world and what is true...


But the biggest problem of map-making is not that we have to start from scratch(从头开始), but that if our maps are to be accurate we have to continually revise them. The world itself is constantly(不断地) changing. Glaciers come, glaciers go. Cultures come, cultures go. There is too little technology, there is too much technology. Even more dramatically, the vantage(优势) point from which we view the world is constantly and quite rapidly changing. When we are children we are dependent, powerless. As adults we may be powerful. Yet in illness or an infirm(体弱多病地) old age we may become powerless and dependent again. When we have children to care for, the world looks different from when we have none; when we are raising infants, the world seems different from when we are raising adolescents. When we are poor, the world looks different from when we are rich. We are daily bombarded(轰炸) with new information as to the nature of reality. If we are to incorporate(合并) this information, we must continually revise our maps, and sometimes when enough new information has accumulated(积累), we must make very major revisions(修订版本). The process of making revisions, particularly major revisions, is painful, sometimes excruciatingly(难以忍受地) painful. And herein lies the major source of many of the ills of mankind.


What happens when one has striven(努力) long and hard to develop a working view of the world, a seemingly(看似) useful, workable map, and then is confronted with new information suggesting that that view is wrong and the map needs to be largely redrawn? The painful effort required seems frightening(可怕的), almost overwhelming(压倒性的). What we do more often than not(往往), and usually unconsciously, is to ignore the new information.


Often this act of ignoring is much more than passive. We may denounce(谴责) the new information as false, dangerous, heretical(异端的), the work of the devil(恶魔). We may actually crusade(讨伐) against it, and even attempt to manipulate(操纵) the world so as to make it conform(符合) to our view of reality. Rather than try to change the map, an individual may try to destroy the new reality. Sadly, such a person may expend(消耗) more energy ultimately in defending an outmoded(过时的) view of the world than would have been required to revise and correct it in the first place.
# My Understanding
* 实现自律，或者说处理解决问题的痛的第三个工具，是忠于事实。我们的真实观就像一个地图，地图越真实和准确，我们就越能知道我们在哪里，如果我们决定了我们想去哪里，我们就能知道如何到达那里。
* 虽然这很明显，但是人们往往ignore。因为我们不能生而带着地图的，我们要绘制地图。世界一直在改变，新信息持续产生，我们需要一直修正地图，这是需要长期努力的。
* 当我们长期努力绘制的地图面对新信息，看上去需要重大改变或者重画时，需要的努力时巨大的，甚至可怕的，我们往往无意识的忽略信息。
* 这种忽略往往不是被动的。我们谴责、讨伐新信息。而不是改变地图。令人悲伤的，维护这个过时的地图需要的能量，最终会比一开始就修正要大的多。
