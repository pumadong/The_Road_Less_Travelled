Life is difficult.
This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths.
**The first of the "Four Noble Truths" which Buddha taught was "Life is suffering."**

It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult-once we truly understand and accept itthen life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.

Most do not fully see this truth that life is difficult. Instead they moan more or less incessantly(不断地), noisily(吵闹地) or subtly(隐隐约约地), about enormity of their problems, their burdens, and their difficulties as if life were generally easy, as if life *should* be easy. They voice their belief(看法), noisily or subtly, that their difficulties represent a unique kind of affliction(折磨) that should not be and that has somehow(不知为什么地) been especially visited upon them, or else upon their families, their trible, their class, their nation, their race or even their species, and not upon others. I know about this moaning because I have done my share.

Life is a series of problems. Do we want to moan about them or solve them? Do we want to teach our children to solve them?
Discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems. Without descipline we can solve nothing. With only some descipline we can solve only some problems. With total discipline we can solve all problems.

What makes life difficult is that the process of confronting and solving problems is a painful one. Problems, depending upon their nature, evoke(唤起) in us frustration or grief(悲伤) or sadness or loneliness or guilt(内疚) or regret or anger or fear or auxiety(焦虑) or anguish(剧痛) or despair(绝望). These are uncomfortable feelings, often very uncomfortable, often as painful as any kind of physical pain, sometimes equaling the very worst kind of physical pain. Indeed, it is because of the pain that events or conflicts engender(产生) in us all that we call them problems. And since life poses(引起) an endless series of problems, life is always difficult and is full of pain as well as joy.

Yet it is in this whole process of meeting and solving problems that life has its meaning. Problems are the cutting edge(前沿) that distinguishes between success and failure. Problems call forth our courage and our wisdom; indeed, they create our courage and our wisdom. It is only because of problems that we grow mentally and spiritually. We desire to encourage the growth of the human spirit, we challenge and encourage the human capacity to solve problems, just as in school we deliberately(故意地) set problems for our children to solve. It is through the pain of confronting and resolving problems that we learn. As Benjamin Franklink said, "Those things that hurt, instruct(教)." It is for this reason that wise people learn no to dread(畏惧) but actually to welcome problems and actually to welcome the pain of problems.

Most of us are not so wise. Fearing the pain involved, almost all of us, to a greater or lesser degree, attempt to avoid problems. We procrastinate, hoping that they will go away. We ignore them, forget them, pretend they do not exist. We even take drugs to assist us in ignoring them, so that by deadening(迟钝) ourselves to the pain we can forget the problems that cause the pain. We attempt to skirt around problems rather than meet them head on. We attempt to get out of them rather than suffer through them.

This tendency to avoid problems and emotional suffering inherent in them is the primary basis of all human mental illness. Since most of us have this tendency to a greater or lesser degree, most of us are mentally ill to a greater or lesser degree, lacking complete mental health. Some of us will go to quite extraordinary lengths to avoid our problems and the suffering they cause, proceeding(行动) far afield(遥远地) from all that is clearly good and sensible in order to try to find an easy way out, building the most elaborate(精心制作的) fantasies in which to live, sometimes to the total exclusion of reality. In the succinctly(简洁地) elegant(优雅地) words of Carl Jung, "Neurosis is always a substitute(替代品) for legitimate(合情合理地的) suffering."

But the substitute itself ultimately becomes more painful than the legitimate suffering it was designed to avoid. The neurosis itself becomes the biggest problem. True to form(一如往常), many will then attempt to avoid this pain and this problem in turn, building layer upon layer of neurosis. Fortunately, however, some possess(拥有) the courage to face their neuroses and begin-usually with the help of psychotherapy-to learn how to experience legitimate suffering. In any case, when we avoid the legitimate suffering that results from dealing with problems, we also avoid the growth that problems demand from us. It is for this reason that in chronic mental illness we stop growing, we become stuck. And without healing, the human spirit begins to shrivel(萎缩).

Therefore let us inculcate(教育) in ourselves and in our children the means of achieving mental and spiritual health. By this I mean let us teach ourselves and our children the necessity for suffering and the value thereof(在其中地), the need to face problems directly and to experience the pain involved. I have stated that discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems. It will become clear that these tools are techniques of suffering, means by which we experience the pain of problems in such a way as to work them through and solve them sucessfully, learning and growing in the process. When we teach ourselves and our children discipline, we are teaching them and ourselves how to suffer and also how to grow.

What are these tools, these techniques of suffering, these means of experiencing the pain of problems constructively that I call discipline? There are four: delaying of gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing. As will be evident, these are not complex tools whose application demands extensive(大量地) training. To the contrary, they are simple tools, and almost all children are adept(熟练地) in their use by the age of ten. Yet presidents and kings will often forget to use them, to their own downfall(帝国地毁灭). The problem lies not in the complexity of these tools but in the will to use them. For they are tools with which pain is confronted rather than avoided, and if one seeks to avoid legitimate suffering, then one will avoid the use of these tools. Therefore, after analyzing each of these tools, we shall in the next section examine the will to use them, which  is love.
# My Understanding
> 一旦接受了“生活本来就有很多痛苦”这种观点，面对痛苦就不是个事了。
> 解决生活的问题需要自律，不同程度的自律解决不同程度的问题。
痛苦的原因是不愿意面对问题。而面对和解决问题才是人生的意义。
Problem区分成功和失败，处于cutting edge，唤起勇气和智慧，或者说Create。 通过解决问题，We learn。
Wise people，不害怕问题，欢迎问题和pain of problems。
Most of us，逃避问题。 这是人类精神问题基本的primary basis。
Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.
但是，逃避问题变成了最大的问题。避免合理的痛苦，也就停止了成长，精神开始枯萎。
我们要教育自己和孩子，痛苦和内在价值，面对问题和经受阵痛的必要性。
解决问题的工具是自律。
自律是什么？
延迟满足、承担责任、忠于事实、平衡。
这些是很简单的工具，10岁的孩子就可以用。
所以问题在于是否有意愿去用这些工具。
因为这些工具是用来直面痛苦，而不是逃避问题。如果一个人寻求避免合理的痛苦，他就会避免使用这些工具。
所以，分析完这些工具之后，我们在Love这一章节，会检查用这些工具的意愿，那就是爱!!!
