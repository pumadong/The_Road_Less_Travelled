# Introduction
***

The ideas herein(在此,adverb) presented stem(起源于,verb), for the most part, from my day-to-day clinical work with my patients as they struggled to avoid or to gain ever greater levels of maturity(成熟). Consequently, this book contains portions of many actual case histories. Confidentiality(保密性) is essential to psychiatirc practice, and all case descriptions, therefore, have been altered in name and in other particulars so as to preserve the anonymity(匿名) of my patients without distorting(歪曲) the essential reality of our experience with each other.

There may, however, be some distortion(变形) by virtue of(由于) the brevity of the case presentations. Psychotherapy is seldom a brief process, but since I have, of necessity, focused on the highlights of a case, the reader may be left with the impression that the process is one of drama and clarity. The drama is real and clarity may eventually be achieved, but it should be remembered that in the interest of readability, accounts(描述) of the lengthy periods of confusion and frustration inherent(固有的) in most therapy have been omitted from these case descriptions.

I would also like to apologize for continually referring to God in the traditionally masculine(男性的) image, but I have done so in the interest of simplicity rather than from any rigidly(顽固的) held concept as to gender.
As a psychiatrist, I feel it is important to mention at the outset(开始) two assumptions that underlie this book. One is that I make no distinction between the mind and the spirit, and therefore no distinction between the process of achieving spiritual growth and mental growth. They are one and the same.

The other assumption is that this process is a complex, arduous(艰巨的) and lifelong(终身的) task. Psychotherapy, if it is to provide substantial(大量的) assistance to the process of mental and spiritual growth, is not a quick or simple prodecure. I do not belong to any particular school of psychiatry(精神病学) or psychotherapy(精神疗法); I am not simply a Freudian or Jungian or Adlerian or behaviorist or gestaltist(完形心理学拥护者). I do not believe there are any single easy answers. I believe that brief forms of psychotherapy may be helpful and are not to be decried(谴责), but the help they provide is inevitably(不可避免地) superficial.

The jouryney of spiritual growth is a long one. I would like to thank those of my patients who have give me the privilege of accompanying them for major portions of their journey. For their journey has also been mine, and much of what is presented here is what we have learned together. I would also like to thank many of my teachers and colleagues. Principal among them is my wife, Lily. She has been so giving(慷慨的) that it is hardly possible to distinguish her wisdome as a spouse(配偶), parent, psychotherapist, and person from my own.
# My Understanding

描述本书思想的源泉。它来源于作者作为心里医生的职业经历、感悟、总结、深入思考、升华。
然后本书预设两种假设：
* 第一，不区分mind和spirit。
* 第二，心里治疗是一个复杂、艰巨、终身的过程。
