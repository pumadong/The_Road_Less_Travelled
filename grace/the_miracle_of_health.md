# The Miracle of Health(健康的奇迹)

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch(不幸的人) like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found,  
Was blind, but now I see.

T‘ was grace that taught my heart to fear,  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious(宝贵的) did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toil(苦干) and snares(陷阱),  
I have already come;  
‘Tis grace hath(有) brought me safe thus far,  
And grade will lead me home.

And when we've been there ten thousand years,  
Bright shining as the sun,  
We'll have no less days to sing God's praise  
Then when we first begin

The first word associated with grace in this famous early American evangelical(福音的) hymn(赞美诗) is "amazing." Something amazes us when it is not in the ordinary course of things, when it is not predictable by what we know of "natural law." What follows will demonstrate grace to be a common phenomenon and, to a certain extent, a predictable one. But the reality of grace will remain unexplainable within the conceptual framework of conventional(依照惯例的) science and "natural law" as we understand it. It will remain miraculous(奇迹般的) and amazing(神奇的).
